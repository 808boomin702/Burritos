Write a program that will allow a robot to assemble 25 burritos. Use a random generator for each burrito option and build a list of 25 burrito customizations:

Rice: white, brown, none
Meat: chicken, steak, carnidas, chorizo, sofritas, veggies
Beans: pinto, black, none
Salsa: mild, medium, hot, none, all
Veggies: lettuce, fajita veggies, none, all
Cheese: yes/no
Guac: yes/no
Queso: yes/no
Sour cream: yes/no
Start with a minimum of 5 ingredients for a burrito. If you still have time at the end, you can add more ingredients.

If you finish the project before 3pm then display a price for each burrito. Pricing will be $3.00 plus .50 for each ingredient.

Then modify your program to use methods. For example, you can call a method from main whose sole purpose is to calculate the price of the burrito.

PSEUDOCODE 
BEGIN
  PROMPT USER FOR BURRITO OPTIONS (RICE, MEAT, BEANS, SALSA, VEGGIES, CHEESE, GUAC, QUESO, SOUT CREAM)
  SAVE BURRITO INGREDIENT OPTIONS
  PROMPT USER FOR PRICE OF EACH BURRITO ($3.00)
  SAVE PRICE OF EACH BURRITO + .50 FOR EACH INGREDIENTS
  ADD A LOOP FOR ALL #25 BURRITOS + RANDOM INGREDIENT GENERATOR WITH A MINIMUM OF 5 INGREDIENTS
THEN
  DISPLAY ALL 25 BURRITOS
